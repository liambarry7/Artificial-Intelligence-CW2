    TO DO:
        PART 2A
        - Google MediaPipe for image feature extraction and data labelling
        - Useful link/documentation for mediapipe: https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker/python
        
        PART 2B
        Pre-proccessing of dataset
        - clean data
        - apply any other pre-proccessing steps necessary
        - explain why and compare before and after of data distribution
        
        PART 2C
        Supervised learning, optimising, evaluation and comparing classifiers
        - Decision tree
        - kNN (standard libraries only)
        - a third classifier of our choice
        - split dataset into training and test sets
        - justify and explain strategy for splitting the data
        - optimise and compare classifiers
            - fine tune at least 2 common hyperparameters, using 5-fold cross validation
            - use a range of performance metrics to assess modesl (e.g. accuracy, sensitivity)
            - choose the best model across all hyperparameter settings and explain why
            - assess best model on whole training set w/ best hyperparameters - report test accuracy and 
              compare it to classifier performance
            - create tables, plots, confusion matrix to report key information, like class distribution
              performance at aech hyperparameter setting and best models performance on training and test sets
            - present and effectively discuss the process you followed to optimise the classifiers - effectively 
              compare the performance of them and justify the best one
              
        PART 2D
        Unsupervised learning and clustering data
        - remove class labels from dataset and apply clustering algorithsm
        - e.g. use K-means or hierarchical clustering
        - analyse clusters formed, report effectiveness of each clustering method
        - compare clustering outputs with best classifier models and report findings
        
        PART 2E
        Academic poster
        
        PART 3
        Individual written report
